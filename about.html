							<h3>Motivation</h3>
							<p align="justify">Chad Errol Booc, a Department of Computer Science alumnus and activist, 
								was one of the victims of the ‘New Bataan 5 massacre’, a brutal raid dubbed a "rescue operation". 
								After graduating cum laude, he chose the path less traveled: he volunteered as a mathematics teacher at 
								a school for Lumad children. Accused of being a member of the NPA and recruiting minors for military 
								activity despite his good intentions for the underserved, he has been constantly red-tagged by the 
								military, even after his death.</p>
							<p align="justify">Deciding on which topic to proceed with was not an easy task. Amongst other instances of online 
								mis/disinformation (e.g., COVID-19 cures, K-12 abolishment), Booc’s case study seemed to be the 
								most sensitive, especially to UPD-DCS students like us, as this involves an individual who must not 
								be dehumanized with numbers. However, given the current political context—where red-tagging has grown 
								more common and deadly as a result of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) of 2020—we have chosen to proceed 
								with this subject with the utmost caution.</p>

							<h3>Problem</h3>
							<p align="justify">Red-tagging is the act of branding and accusing individuals or groups of being terrorists or communists 
								(<a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/434/article/829487/pdf">Guevarra & Arcilla, 2020</a>). Due to the signing of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020, red-tagging has become 
								a more pressing danger. With its vague definition for ‘terrorism’, the ATA allows the government to target human rights defenders and activists, 
								violating the Filipinos’ freedom of expression (<a href="https://www.icj.org/philippines-cease-dangerous-practice-of-red-tagging-human-rights-defenders/">Tan, 2022</a>). 
								More crucially, multiple studies and news have shown that there seems to be a correlation between red-tagging and 
								extrajudicial killings in the Philippines (<a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/883277">Espiritu, 2022</a>; 
								<a href="https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/252028-lives-in-danger-duterte-government-red-tagging-campaign/">Gavilan, 2020</a>, 
								<a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/spotlight/02/25/21/philippine-critics-in-firing-line-of-anti-communist-misinformation-war">Morella et al., 2021</a>).</p>

							<h3>Solution</h3>
							<p align="justify">With the hopes of increasing awareness about the dangers of red-tagging and gathering knowledge that can aid 
								in the creation of more solutions that can put an end to it, this project aims to verify the existence of 
								red-tagging of Lumad school teacher Chad Booc and quantify its prevalence.</p>
